#GIVEN A LIST....
lst = [1,7,2,6,3,5,4,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,22]

# (Google any you don't know how to do)
# print the 1st element list
# print the 5th element of the list
# print the first 10 elements
# print the 5th to 10th element
# print the last element
# print the 2nd to last element
# print the list in reverse order
# print the every other element in the list
# print the every 3rd element in the list
# print the every other element of the 1st 12 elements of the list
# (This one's tricky) print the every other element of the 1st 12 elements of the list in reverse order
